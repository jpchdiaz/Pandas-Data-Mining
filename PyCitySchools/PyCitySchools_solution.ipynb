    "##### Top and Bottom Performing Schools\n",
    "- The most immediate observation is that Charter schools populate the top 5 performing schools and District schools populate the bottom 5 performing schools for standardized test scores. \n",
    "- Overall, District schools had lower standardized test scores than Charter schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Subject Grades\n",
    "- Math and Reading standardized test scores seem to stay the same across the board between grades in a school. \n",
    "- If the test grades deviated wildly from each other between different grades, further analysis would be required. That doesn't appear to be the case.\n",
    "- Therefore, any solutions that would improve one grade's performance would probably work for all the other grades as well, across most of these schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Budget & Population\n",
    "- Large Schools (population greater than 2000 students) appear to have a significantly lower overall passing rate than schools with less than 2000 students, by about 20%.\n",
    "- It appears the more that schools spent on their students in \\$\\$ amounts, the less well they performed on these standardized tests.\n",
    "- Charter schools have smaller budgets than District schools. They also have fewer students.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Conclusions\n",
    "- Given the observations and conditions above, one of the conclusions we might draw from this dataset is that a higher school budget doesn't necessarily mean better performance on standardized tests.\n",
    "- Perhaps there is a correlation between the *size* of a school and performance on standardized tests, however, and it would be a good set of data to delve further into.\n",
    "- Specifically, this data shows that the more students a school has, the worse its performance on standardized tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Opinions\n",
    "- This could be the result of numerous factors; in my opinion it would be due to the lack of attention to every individual student in the time crunch required of teachers to get their lessons across. However this data doesn't necessarily prove that theory in and of itself so we would require further data. Perhaps something like *Average Amount of Time Teacher Spends With Individual Students* or something similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Other \n",
    "- Why is there someone named 'Dr. Richard Scott' in the student list under Huang High School? Are some teachers actually mixed in with these students? What if some of them don't have prefixes like 'Dr.' in their name? Does this data need further scrubbing? My numbers seem generally the same as the example results we were shown so I'm just going to trust the teachers on this one."
